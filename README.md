# Django Poll App Tutorial

Django is a python-based web framework that follows the **model-template-view** architechtual pattern. Django is fast, secure, and scalable! <br>
This is my first Django project, a simple poll app built with help from [this tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/)

## Django Basic Overview

For more detailed notes, take a look at the [notes folder](https://github.com/AnniePawl/Django-Poll-App/tree/master/django_notes) in this repo.

### Models

[My models notes](https://github.com/AnniePawl/Django-Poll-App/blob/master/django_notes/Models.md) <br>
A model is a single, definitive source of truth that contains essential feilds and behaviors for data. You can use Django w/o a database, but it comes with an object-relational mapper. When models are defined, Django can automatically creates a professional adnminstrative interface.

### Templates

[My template notes](https://github.com/AnniePawl/Django-Poll-App/blob/master/django_notes/Templates.md) <br>
Templates define the look and feel of a site and provides "holes" for child templates to fill.

### Views

[My view notes](https://github.com/AnniePawl/Django-Poll-App/blob/master/django_notes/Views.md) <br>
A view is a type of webpage that generally serves a specific function and has a specific template. Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: returning an HttpResponse object, or raising an exception.
